## 🌟 Vision: Ending Procurement Corruption Through Blockchain Transparency

**TransparencyX** is a revolutionary decentralized, AI-enhanced government procurement system built on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet using PYUSD stablecoin. Our mission is to combat public sector corruption through immutable financial transparency, automated fraud detection, and public accountability mechanisms.

### The Problem We're Solving: The Global Corruption Crisis

![Corruption Stats](demo/images/corruption.png)

Government procurement corruption represents one of the most significant challenges to global development:

- **$9.5 trillion** lost annually to corruption in developing countries (World Economic Forum)
- Government procurement accounts for **15-30%** of GDP in most countries, with an estimated **20-30%** lost to corruption
- Only **14%** of major corruption cases lead to recovery of stolen assets (UN)
- Over **120 journalists** have been killed exposing corruption cases in the last decade
- Corruption reduces economic growth by **0.5-1%** annually in affected regions
- The World Bank estimates **$1 trillion** is paid in bribes each year globally

In 2018, Indian journalist Gauri Lankesh was assassinated after investigating a major procurement scandal. Her death inspired this project—creating a system where such investigations would be unnecessary because all transactions would be transparent by design.

## 🔍 System Architecture & Innovation

TransparencyX provides end-to-end transparency for government procurement through an innovative combination of blockchain, AI, and public oversight:

![System Workflow](demo/images/workflow.png)

### Complete Procurement Flow

1. **Budget Allocation**: Government funds are locked in PYUSD and allocated transparently to departments
2. **Vendor Selection**: All vendor selections are recorded immutably on the blockchain
3. **Claim Submission**: Vendors submit claims with IPFS-stored invoice documentation
4. **AI-Verification**: Document AI extracts invoice details and ML detects anomalies
5. **Payment Chain Tracking**: All payments to vendors, suppliers, and sub-suppliers are tracked
6. **Public Oversight**: Citizens can challenge suspicious claims by staking PYUSD
7. **Dispute Resolution**: Challenges are reviewed with stake rewards for valid concerns

### What Makes TransparencyX Different?

Unlike traditional procurement systems or basic blockchain implementations, TransparencyX:

- **Tracks the complete payment chain** from government to sub-suppliers (not just tier-1 vendors)
- **Incorporates AI verification** of claims and documents before approval
- **Enables public participation** in the oversight process with economic incentives
- **Uses GCP's Blockchain RPC** for powerful transaction tracing that would be cost-prohibitive otherwise
- **Integrates with BigQuery** for advanced analytics and pattern recognition
- **Operates with PYUSD stablecoin** for reliable value storage without cryptocurrency volatility

## ⚙️ Core Technical Components

### 1. Role-Based Access Control System

TransparencyX implements strict role separation to prevent fraud and ensure proper oversight:

![RBAC System](demo/images/rbac.png)

#### Role Hierarchy and Responsibilities

- **Main Government**: 
  - Locks overall budget for fiscal periods
  - Sets overall spending policies
  - Appoints state heads and auditors
  - Final approval for large transactions

- **State Heads**: 
  - Allocate budgets to specific departments/projects
  - Monitor departmental spending
  - Approve major procurement decisions

- **Deputies**: 
  - Select and vet vendors for specific projects
  - Set project-specific spending parameters
  - Preliminary approval of large claims

- **Vendors**: 
  - Submit claims with IPFS-stored invoices
  - Receive PYUSD payments
  - Pay suppliers with transparent tracking

- **Suppliers & Sub-suppliers**: 
  - Receive payments in traceable chain
  - Register in the system for payment
  - Provide goods/services documentation

- **Public**: 
  - View all non-sensitive transactions
  - Challenge suspicious claims with PYUSD stakes
  - Earn rewards for identifying fraud

#### Implementation in Smart Contract

```solidity
// Role definitions
bytes32 public constant MAIN_GOVERNMENT_ROLE = keccak256("MAIN_GOVERNMENT_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant STATE_HEAD_ROLE = keccak256("STATE_HEAD_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant DEPUTY_ROLE = keccak256("DEPUTY_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant VENDOR_ROLE = keccak256("VENDOR_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant SUPPLIER_ROLE = keccak256("SUPPLIER_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant AI_SYSTEM_ROLE = keccak256("AI_SYSTEM_ROLE");

// Role management
function grantStateHeadRole(address account) public onlyRole(MAIN_GOVERNMENT_ROLE) {
    _grantRole(STATE_HEAD_ROLE, account);
    emit RoleGranted(STATE_HEAD_ROLE, account, msg.sender);
}

// Role-based access control example
function allocateBudget(
    address department,
    uint256 amount,
    string memory description
) public onlyRole(STATE_HEAD_ROLE) {
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(department != address(0), "Invalid department address");
    
    // Transfer PYUSD from state budget to department
    bool success = pyusd.transferFrom(address(this), department, amount);
    require(success, "PYUSD transfer failed");
    
    departmentAllocations[department] += amount;
    
    emit BudgetAllocated(department, amount, description, msg.sender);
}
```

### 2. GCP Blockchain RPC Integration (Key Innovation)

Our system leverages Google Cloud Platform's Blockchain RPC service to provide powerful transaction tracing capabilities that would be cost-prohibitive with other providers:

![AI System](demo/images/AI.png)

#### Deep Transaction Tracing

The GCP Blockchain RPC service allows TransparencyX to:

1. **Trace complete payment chains** from government to vendors to suppliers to sub-suppliers
2. **Analyze internal transaction details** that are normally invisible to regular blockchain queries
3. **Detect suspicious patterns** by examining transaction graphs across multiple payments
4. **Optimize gas costs** by offloading heavy computational tasks to GCP

#### Technical Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * Trace a complete payment chain from government to all sub-suppliers
 * This function leverages GCP's Blockchain RPC debug_traceTransaction method
 * to extract detailed transaction data that would be prohibitively expensive
 * to process on-chain.
 */
async function tracePaymentChain(txHash) {
  // Get the transaction trace with full call data
  const trace = await provider.send("debug_traceTransaction", [txHash, {
    tracer: "callTracer",
    tracerConfig: { 
      onlyTopCall: false,
      withLog: true,
      withStorage: true
    }
  }]);
  
  // Extract the complete payment flow data
  const paymentFlow = {
    origin: trace.from,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    value: trace.value,
    participants: []
  };
  
  // Process all internal calls recursively
  function processInternalCalls(call, depth = 0) {
    if (call.type === "CALL" && call.value > 0) {
      paymentFlow.participants.push({
        address: call.to,
        value: call.value,
        depth: depth,
        methodId: call.input.substring(0, 10)
      });
    }
    
    // Process recursive calls
    if (call.calls && call.calls.length > 0) {
      call.calls.forEach(subcall => processInternalCalls(subcall, depth + 1));
    }
  }
  
  // Process the trace data
  processInternalCalls(trace);
  
  // Upload the complete payment flow to BigQuery for analysis
  await uploadToBigQuery("payment_flows", paymentFlow);
  
  // Return the processed payment flow
  return paymentFlow;
}
```

This approach allows us to create a complete graph of all payments related to a government contract, including:

- **Direct vendor payments**
- **Vendor-to-supplier transfers**
- **Supplier-to-subcontractor payments**
- **Payment timing patterns**
- **Unusual transaction routing**

Without GCP's Blockchain RPC service, this level of analysis would require:

1. Custom instrumentation of every contract in the payment chain
2. Significantly higher gas costs for event emission
3. Multiple separate queries to reconstruct payment flows
4. Limited visibility into internal transaction details

#### BigQuery Integration for Advanced Analytics

All traced transaction data is stored in BigQuery for advanced analysis:

```javascript
/**
 * Upload payment flow data to BigQuery for analysis
 */
async function uploadToBigQuery(dataset, paymentData) {
  // Create a BigQuery client
  const bigquery = new BigQuery();
  
  // Define the table schema
  const schema = [
    { name: 'txHash', type: 'STRING' },
    { name: 'timestamp', type: 'TIMESTAMP' },
    { name: 'originAddress', type: 'STRING' },
    { name: 'totalValue', type: 'NUMERIC' },
    { name: 'paymentChain', type: 'RECORD', mode: 'REPEATED', fields: [
      { name: 'address', type: 'STRING' },
      { name: 'value', type: 'NUMERIC' },
      { name: 'depth', type: 'INTEGER' },
      { name: 'methodId', type: 'STRING' }
    ]}
  ];
  
  // Insert the data
  await bigquery
    .dataset(dataset)
    .table('transaction_traces')
    .insert(paymentData);
    
  console.log(`Payment flow data uploaded to BigQuery: ${paymentData.txHash}`);
}
```

### 3. AI-Enhanced Verification System

Our system uses advanced AI to verify claims before they're approved:

#### Document AI Pipeline

1. **Document Extraction**: Invoice images/PDFs are processed to extract structured data
2. **Data Validation**: Extracted data is validated against claim information
3. **Anomaly Detection**: ML models identify suspicious patterns in claims
4. **IPFS Storage**: All documents are stored with immutable IPFS hashes

#### Sample AI Processing Flow

```python
def process_invoice(invoice_file, claim_data):
    """
    Process an invoice using Document AI and detect anomalies
    
    Args:
        invoice_file: The invoice PDF or image
        claim_data: The blockchain claim data for verification
        
    Returns:
        dict: Extracted data, anomaly score, and verification results
    """
    # Extract text and structured data from invoice
    document = document_processor.process_document(invoice_file)
    
    # Extract key fields
    extracted_data = {
        'invoice_number': extract_invoice_number(document),
        'date': extract_date(document),
        'amount': extract_amount(document),
        'vendor_name': extract_vendor_name(document),
        'items': extract_line_items(document)
    }
    
    # Verify extracted data against claim data
    verification_results = verify_claim_against_invoice(claim_data, extracted_data)
    
    # Calculate anomaly score using ML model
    features = prepare_features(extracted_data, claim_data)
    anomaly_score = anomaly_model.predict_proba([features])[0][1] * 100
    
    # Store document in IPFS
    ipfs_hash = upload_to_ipfs(invoice_file)
    
    return {
        'extracted_data': extracted_data,
        'verification_results': verification_results,
        'anomaly_score': anomaly_score,
        'ipfs_hash': ipfs_hash,
        'is_suspicious': anomaly_score > 70
    }
```

#### Anomaly Detection Features

Our ML model looks for common patterns of procurement fraud:

- **Price inflation**: Comparing prices to market benchmarks
- **Split purchases**: Detecting multiple small purchases that should be single contracts
- **Shell company indicators**: Unusual company registration patterns or addresses
- **Unusual timing**: Suspicious patterns in submission timing
- **Document irregularities**: Inconsistencies in invoice formatting or details

### 4. Complete Payment Chain Tracking

TransparencyX uniquely tracks the complete payment chain from government to end supplier:

#### Smart Contract Implementation

```solidity
// Vendor pays a supplier from their received funds
function paySupplier(
    uint256 claimId,
    address supplier,
    uint256 amount,
    string memory description
) public onlyVendor {
    require(claims[claimId].vendor == msg.sender, "Not the claim vendor");
    require(claims[claimId].status == ClaimStatus.Paid, "Claim not paid");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(supplier != address(0), "Invalid supplier address");
    
    uint256 paymentId = nextSupplierPaymentId++;
    supplierPayments[paymentId] = SupplierPayment({
        claimId: claimId,
        supplier: supplier,
        amount: amount,
        description: description,
        createTime: block.timestamp
    });
    
    // Transfer PYUSD from vendor to supplier
    bool success = pyusd.transferFrom(msg.sender, supplier, amount);
    require(success, "PYUSD transfer failed");
    
    emit SupplierPaid(paymentId, claimId, msg.sender, supplier, amount, description);
}

// Supplier pays a sub-supplier from their received funds
function paySubSupplier(
    uint256 supplierPaymentId, 
    address subSupplier,
    uint256 amount,
    string memory description
) public {
    require(supplierPayments[supplierPaymentId].supplier == msg.sender, "Not the payment supplier");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
    require(subSupplier != address(0), "Invalid sub-supplier address");
    
    uint256 subPaymentId = nextSubSupplierPaymentId++;
    subSupplierPayments[subPaymentId] = SubSupplierPayment({
        supplierPaymentId: supplierPaymentId,
        subSupplier: subSupplier,
        amount: amount,
        description: description,
        createTime: block.timestamp
    });
    
    // Transfer PYUSD from supplier to sub-supplier
    bool success = pyusd.transferFrom(msg.sender, subSupplier, amount);
    require(success, "PYUSD transfer failed");
    
    emit SubSupplierPaid(subPaymentId, supplierPaymentId, msg.sender, subSupplier, amount, description);
}
```

### 5. Public Challenge System

TransparencyX empowers citizens to actively participate in procurement oversight:

#### Challenge Mechanism

```solidity
// Public stakes PYUSD to challenge a suspicious claim
function stakeChallenge(
    uint256 claimId,
    string memory reason
) public {
    require(claims[claimId].status != ClaimStatus.Rejected, "Claim already rejected");
    require(pyusd.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= stakingAmount, "Insufficient PYUSD balance");
    
    uint256 challengeId = nextChallengeId++;
    challenges[challengeId] = Challenge({
        claimId: claimId,
        challenger: msg.sender,
        reason: reason,
        resolved: false,
        valid: false,
        createTime: block.timestamp,
        resolveTime: 0
    });
    
    // Transfer staking amount from challenger to contract
    bool success = pyusd.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), stakingAmount);
    require(success, "PYUSD transfer failed");
    
    // If enough challenges, automatically flag the claim
    claimChallengeCount[claimId]++;
    if (claimChallengeCount[claimId] >= autoFlagThreshold && claims[claimId].status == ClaimStatus.Pending) {
        claims[claimId].status = ClaimStatus.Flagged;
        emit ClaimFlagged(claimId, "Multiple public challenges received");
    }
    
    emit ChallengeSubmitted(challengeId, claimId, msg.sender, reason);
}

// Resolve a challenge and reward staker if valid
function resolveChallenge(
    uint256 challengeId,
    bool isValid,
    string memory resolution
) public onlyRole(MAIN_GOVERNMENT_ROLE) {
    Challenge storage challenge = challenges[challengeId];
    require(!challenge.resolved, "Challenge already resolved");
    
    challenge.resolved = true;
    challenge.valid = isValid;
    challenge.resolveTime = block.timestamp;
    
    uint256 claimId = challenge.claimId;
    
    if (isValid) {
        // Reward the challenger
        bool success = pyusd.transfer(challenge.challenger, stakingAmount * rewardMultiplier);
        require(success, "PYUSD reward transfer failed");
        
        // Mark claim as rejected if it's not already
        if (claims[claimId].status != ClaimStatus.Rejected) {
            claims[claimId].status = ClaimStatus.Rejected;
            emit ClaimRejected(claimId, "Valid public challenge");
        }
    } else {
        // Return staking amount to contract treasury
        treasuryBalance += stakingAmount;
    }
    
    emit ChallengeResolved(challengeId, claimId, isValid, resolution);
}
```

## 🌐 Impact and Conclusion

TransparencyX demonstrates how blockchain technology, specifically PYUSD on Ethereum, can transform government procurement by:

1. **Eliminating opportunities for corruption** through immutable transaction records
2. **Reducing investigation costs** through AI-powered automatic verification
3. **Increasing public trust** through stakeholder participation in the verification process
4. **Creating accountability** throughout the entire payment chain
5. **Providing powerful analytics** for systemic improvement

By leveraging GCP's Blockchain RPC service for transaction tracing, we've created a system that would be prohibitively expensive to implement with traditional blockchain methods, making it feasible for government-scale applications.

While our current implementation is on the Sepolia testnet, which has some limitations, the system is designed to work seamlessly on mainnet where even more powerful tracing and analysis would be possible. The potential impact of TransparencyX is enormous, potentially saving trillions of dollars currently lost to procurement corruption while creating more efficient, trustworthy government operations.
