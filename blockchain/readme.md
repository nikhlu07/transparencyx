# TransparencyX: Blockchain-Powered Government Procurement

![TransparencyX System Architecture](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=TransparencyX+System+Architecture)

## 🌟 Overview

TransparencyX is a corruption-proof government procurement system built on Ethereum blockchain technology. Our flagship smart contract `ClearGov.sol` creates an immutable, transparent record of all government procurement activities. Developed for the PYUSD ClearGov Hackathon, this solution tackles the $2 trillion annual losses to corruption worldwide (UN estimate).

### Core Components

- **Blockchain Layer**: Deployed on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet with PYUSD stablecoin integration
- **AI Verification**: ML-powered anomaly detection for procurement claims
- **GCP Integration**: Blockchain RPC for comprehensive transaction tracing
- **Public Oversight**: Challenge system allowing citizens to flag suspicious activities

## 🔍 How It Works

TransparencyX implements a sophisticated role-based access control (RBAC) system that mirrors government procurement hierarchies while enforcing transparency at every level:

![Role Hierarchy](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=TransparencyX+Role+Hierarchy)

1. **MainGovernment** locks budgets and approves final claims
2. **StateHeads** allocate budgets to departments
3. **Deputies** select vendors for projects
4. **Vendors** submit claims and pay suppliers
5. **Suppliers** distribute payments to sub-suppliers
6. **SubSuppliers** receive payments for goods/services
7. **Public** can challenge suspicious claims

Every transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain with complete traceability from budget allocation through final payment.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Budget Transparency**: All funds are locked in PYUSD and traceable
- **Complete Payment Chain**: Follows money from government to vendors to suppliers
- **Document Verification**: IPFS integration for secure document storage
- **AI Fraud Detection**: Machine learning identifies anomalous claims
- **Public Challenge System**: Citizens can stake PYUSD to flag suspicious activity
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Every transaction permanently recorded

## 📊 Implementation

![Deployment Workflow](https://via.placeholder.com/700x300?text=TransparencyX+Deployment+Workflow)

TransparencyX is deployed on:
- **Sepolia Testnet**: Using official PYUSD token
- **Holesky Testnet**: Using MockPYUSD for testing

### Integration Points

- **Google Cloud Platform**: Transaction tracing and analytics
- **Document AI**: Automated verification of procurement documentation
- **BigQuery**: Analytics dashboard for spending patterns
- **Web Interface**: Public-facing portal for transparency

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict permission hierarchy
- **Anti-Reentrancy Protection**: Prevents exploit attempts
- **Budget Integrity Checks**: Prevents double-spending
- **Stake-Based Challenge System**: Economic disincentive for frivolous challenges
